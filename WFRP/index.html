            <h2>What is the Wish Fulfillment RP?</h2>
            <p>Normally, when someone asks the question "What would you do if you could do anything?" the answer is somewhat obvious: "Whatever I want."
                However, discovering what it is you want is another question. There are usually a few obvious items, but with <i>all</i> limits removed,
                what will your daily life actually look like?
            </p>
            <p>The Wish Fulfillment RP is in part an attempt for us to answer this question to ourselves.
                Starting at Pathfinder Level 20, our characters are <i>remarkably</i> overpowered compared to most entities in the world in which we're
                playing. Yet, there are still limits on our power -- responsibilities to uphold and dangers to fear. We are not the only Level 20 
                characters. With our mortal limitations and the limitations of physics removed, but the limitations of magic enforced, what <i>now</i>
                do we do?
            </p>
            <p class="smoltxt">(Hint: Have breakdowns about the inconsistency of morality and play around with the concepts of species, gender, and identity.)</p>
