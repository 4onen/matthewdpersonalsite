        <h2>About Me!</h2>
        <p>I'm a 24 year old PhD student working in the Intelligent
            Engineering Assistant (IEA) lab at the University of California,
            Santa Barbara. (UCSB)
        </p>
        <p>By day, I study knowledge graphs and Plotly-Dash. By night I
            study Transformer models, Python, Rust, C, and C++.</p>

        <h2>About This Site.</h2>
        <p>I created this site by hand in vanilla HTML5 and CSS3. No
            frameworks, no generators, no copy-pasted styles. Just me, a
            text editor, and hours of YouTube and Mozilla Developer Network.
        </p>
        <p>The only things I've taken from elsewhere are the external link
            icons on the homepage and the section slant trick on the
            timeline. (The latter has been heavily adapted.)</p>
        <p>Part of the challenge of the site was my goal to make it
            functional without JavaScript. As I frequently browse the web
            with JavaScript disabled (to protect against sandbox escapes) I
            wanted to make my site appealing and similarly capable for
            people of the same opinion as me.</p>
        <p>I also tried to have the site follow accessibility guidelines, at
            least so far as they were flagged by Firefox's accessibility
            inspector. While only basic checks, it led to the labels on the
            icons on the index, which I had initially planned to be an
            unlabeled mess! (It really is true: concern for accessibility
            improves the experience for everyone.)</p>
        <p>Finally, this site supports both light mode and dark mode! Try
            toggling between the two in your browser's inspector or system
            settings to observe how the themes change. I also made use of
            the System Colors specification to, where possible, use the
            browser's choice of text color and background, though other
            colors were selected with the white-on-black/black-on-white
            defaults in mind.</p>
