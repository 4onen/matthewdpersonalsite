        <h1 id="whats-this">What’s this?</h1>
        <p>This blog is a description of some of the design decisions and
            interfaces in Ren’Py underlying many of my AwSW mods. Here, I’m
            trying to explain the ideas that led to the code in the final
            package, as well as help preserve and describe the Ren’Py 6.99
            interfaces necessary to mod <em>Angels with Scaly Wings</em>.
        </p>
        <p>It’s targeted at people who know the basics of modding the game, but
            who want to dig deeper to create more advanced functionality, as
            visible in the mods by EvilChaosKnight, 4onen, Linda, and the AwSW
            modtools themselves.</p>
        <h1 id="why-make-this">Why make this?</h1>
        <p>I’ve noticed recently that the Historic Ren’Py Wiki is slowly being
            replaced on Google Search results by the new Ren’Py documentation.
            While it’s wonderful that the Ren’Py project is finally reaching a
            new level of documentation standards, this older wiki is critical to
            understanding and modifying the game Angels with Scaly Wings (and
            other similarly old Ren’Py titles.) As such, I’m hoping to preserve
            some of the most useful code (at least among the pieces I’ve used)
            to help future modders come back to older titles and at least have a
            foothold into these wonderful games’ engines.</p>
        <h1 id="f.a.q.">F.A.Q.</h1>
        <p>First, the title of this section is a lie. This page was written
            before this blog project was released, so these questions are what I
            assume might be asked.</p>
        <h2 id="how-regularly-will-these-come-out">How regularly will these come
            out?</h2>
        <p>No idea! Whenever each is done, and going until I get bored, I guess?
        </p>
        <h2 id="what-content-are-you-planning-to-cover">What content are you
            planning to cover?</h2>
        <p>I don’t have a clear plan going forward, but some topics I’d like to
            hit are: * The image interfaces used to make my <a href="https://github.com/4onen/AwSW-Side-Images">Side
                Images</a>
            mod (most critically <code>im.Composite</code>, which is used in
            almost all my mods to break displayed images into layered pieces and
            vastly decrease mod file sizes.) * The image recoloration tricks
            used in <a href="https://github.com/4onen/AwSW-Bryce-Teetotaller">Teetotaller</a>
            and <a href="https://github.com/4onen/AwSW-4onen-Aesthetic-Tweaks">4onen’s
                Aesthetic Tweaks</a> to match player colors. * The Ren’Py
            Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) which represents the story in the loaded
            game (and how mods “hook” into it) * The Ren’Py call stack, which
            can be used to vastly reduce code duplication in mods. * The basics
            of the Ren’Py Screen Language 2, as used in <em>Magmalink</em> Mod
            Settings menus * The Ren’Py Animation Transformation Language (ATL)
            used by most of my mods to slide sprites around better than the base
            game does.</p>
        <h2 id="what-skill-level-is-necessary-to-understand-this">What skill
            level is necessary to understand this?</h2>
        <p>I’m assuming some understanding of Python, as I’m targeting this
            series at future modders interested in digging into more complex
            functionality rather than true beginners. Again, if you’re
            interested in modding AwSW but don’t have any idea where to start,
            see Linda’s excellent <a href="https://gitlab.com/jakzie2/awsw-magmalink/-/wikis/home">Magmalink-centered
                tutorials</a>.</p>
