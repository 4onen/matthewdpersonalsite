            <p class="smoltxt">November 10, 2019</p>
            <p>In considering the ethical dilemma reiterated in our previous blog post, we face the question of who our
                decision may affect. There is, present in our decision, both a short-term impact on people directly
                involved in our project and its result, and a possible long-term impact on larger systems the world
                over.</p>
            <p>Our company is transforming our product to be better for the environment as demanded by the market. Here
                are the direct, short-term stakeholders impacted by the results:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Black Lodge Industries -- as the commissioner of the project, and directly benefiting from any
                    discoveries thereof, BLI is an obvious stakeholder.</li>
                <li>Ourselves and our research team -- Face risks from our employers that we might lose our jobs if any
                    individual demonstrates dissent towards developing refillable cartridges.</li>
                <li>BLI Customers -- because refillable cartridges are likely to be more complex and possibly harder to
                    replace, negatively impacting user experience.</li>
                <li>Employment of the factory workers in our hometown -- Local economy may suffer when the production of
                    cartridges comes to an end. Residents of Twin Peaks would undergo unemployment which would have
                    major impact on their daily life.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are also excited for what our new product may potentially bring about for everybody overall, around
                the globe:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Environment -- Continued use of disposable cartridges will lead to serious soil pollution when
                    left in landfill. Refilling cartridges, on the other hand, can conserve energy and natural
                    resources.</li>
                <li>The printer market -- moving on to the reusable cartridges can restore market share since the
                    competitors have developed such products on the printer markets.</li>
                <li>The Human impact -- improving the environmental awareness of the public, convincing people to
                    consume additional green products. And if those products come from BLI, the more the better!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now, given the actual impacts imposed on each of these parties and systems, we consider our stakeholders
                in a particular order of importance to our ethical decision making:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>BLI</li>
                <li>Printer market customers</li>
                <li>Our own jobs</li>
                <li>Environment</li>
                <li>Twin Peaks Economy</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We consider BLI’s interest first and foremost, as they were a valuable employer to us in a time of
                economic slowdown. We feel that helping the company’s success is likely to lead to additional jobs for
                many other people. As a second consideration, the market is currently pushing for environmental
                concerns, and obeying the sway of the market is a reasonable good as it makes many people happier with
                BLI. Third, should we choose to refuse to work on the refillable cartridge project, we would lose our
                jobs, bringing upon ourselves significant economic hardship -- and possibly bringing that upon the
                research team below us as well. Our environmentalism, ignored in the past by BLI, actually is in line
                with their decision-making process in this case, and with the first three points.</p>
            <p>Only last do we consider the economy of our hometown, Twin Peaks. As the disposable cartridge printers
                are likely to exist on the market for some time, there will still be a period during which the company
                can warn of future layoffs and restructuring associated with the reusable cartridge program. With this
                proper warning, residents of Twin Peaks can plan for their financial futures. Though it may require
                moving away, it is unlikely that any of them will face an unavoidable financial crisis.</p>

            <h1 class="nomarg medheader">The Ethical Dilemma Ahead</h1>
            <p class="smoltxt">November 8, 2019</p>
            <p>Our team, Iron Giants, has been tasked with determining an ethical pathway through the following dilemma:
            </p>
            <p>45% of our hometown’s economy relies on Inkjet Printer cartridges, an environmentally unsustainable
                technology providing the cheapest high-resolution printing capabilities on the market. The cartridges
                could be made refillable rather than completely disposable, but the company has elected for the cheaper
                disposable only approach. This leads to a significant environmental concern, but one we have ignored in
                the past due to the economic support its industry provides.</p>
            <p>We have been placed in charge of an R&D team developing a new generation of inkjet printers that do not
                use disposable cartridges. We are concerned because this may lead to downsizing or shutdown of the
                cartridge plant in our hometown, stunting our hometown’s economy and placing many residents in dire
                financial situations. There exists also an environmental concern posed by continuing to produce
                disposable cartridges.
            </p>
            <p>The dilemma presented is the torn concerns between supporting our hometown, or supporting the environment
                and our corporate duty as engineers.</p>
            <p>We are also posed two evolutions of the scenario:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <h1 class="nomarg smallheader">Scenario 2</h1>
                        <p>Some members of our research team are not convinced of the environmental impacts caused by
                            disposable ink cartridges. However, the market is very aware that this is a big problem. A
                            good research team should always consider the demands of the market.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <h1 class="nomarg smallheader">Scenario 3</h1>
                        <p>As our development and research team moves on to a proposal of non-disposable and refillable
                            ink cartridges, it will put more people in unemployment status because of the decrease in
                            the demand of producing cartridges. That raises the ethical dilemma of whether we need to be
                            concerned about the unemployment issue in our hometown while designing the printers for the
                            next generation.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <p class="smoltxt">October 27, 2019</p>
            <p>We are team Iron Giants, members of the UCSB F19 ENGR101 Engineering Ethics class. We are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Matthew Dupree - Webmaster</li>

                <li>Zach Holoien - Presentation Leader</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We should note, the assignment says “You will need to submit a form (available on GS) to your TA listing
                all
                the group
                members and their clearly delineated roles.” However, no such form exists. We hope this initial post
                serves
                as enough
                explanation for you!</p>
