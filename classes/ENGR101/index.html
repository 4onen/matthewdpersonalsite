            <h1 class="nomarg medheader">The Ethical Dilemma Ahead</h1>
            <p class="smoltxt">November 8, 2019</p>
            <p>Our team, Iron Giants, has been tasked with determining an ethical pathway through the following dilemma:
            </p>
            <p>45% of our hometown’s economy relies on Inkjet Printer cartridges, an environmentally unsustainable
                technology providing the cheapest high-resolution printing capabilities on the market. The cartridges
                could be made refillable rather than completely disposable, but the company has elected for the cheaper
                disposable only approach. This leads to a significant environmental concern, but one we have ignored in
                the past due to the economic support its industry provides.</p>
            <p>We have been placed in charge of an R&D team developing a new generation of inkjet printers that do not
                use disposable cartridges. We are concerned because this may lead to downsizing or shutdown of the
                cartridge plant in our hometown, stunting our hometown’s economy and placing many residents in dire
                financial situations. There exists also an environmental concern posed by continuing to produce
                disposable cartridges.
            </p>
            <p>The dilemma presented is the torn concerns between supporting our hometown, or supporting the environment
                and our corporate duty as engineers.</p>
            <p>We are also posed two evolutions of the scenario:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <h1 class="nomarg smallheader">Scenario 2</h1>
                        <p>Some members of our research team are not convinced of the environmental impacts caused by
                            disposable ink cartridges. However, the market is very aware that this is a big problem. A
                            good research team should always consider the demands of the market.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <h1 class="nomarg smallheader">Scenario 3</h1>
                        <p>As our development and research team moves on to a proposal of non-disposable and refillable
                            ink cartridges, it will put more people in unemployment status because of the decrease in
                            the demand of producing cartridges. That raises the ethical dilemma of whether we need to be
                            concerned about the unemployment issue in our hometown while designing the printers for the
                            next generation.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>

            <h1 class="nomarg medheader">Hello World!</h1>
            <p class="smoltxt">October 27, 2019</p>
            <p>We are team Iron Giants, members of the UCSB F19 ENGR101 Engineering Ethics class. We are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Matthew Dupree - Webmaster</li>
                <li>Guanyu Chen - Researcher</li>
                <li>Kerry Mo - Organizing Secretary</li>
                <li>Zach Holoien - Presentation Leader</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We should note, the assignment says “You will need to submit a form (available on GS) to your TA listing
                all
                the group
                members and their clearly delineated roles.” However, no such form exists. We hope this initial post
                serves
                as enough
                explanation for you!</p>
