            <p class="smoltxt">November 11, 2019</p>
            <p>To facilitate independent consideration of the dilemma presented and to minimize groupthink, we split up
                for a day to write out how we applied our frameworks to the issue at hand. These four write-ups are
                below:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <h1 class="nomarg smallheader">MatthewD:</h1>
                        <p>I normally take a pragmatic point of view on ethical issues. However, here, since most
                            affects can be accounted for in terms of long-term ramifications, pragmatism decays to
                            utilitarianism. Thus, utilitarianism is the view I use.</p>
                        <p>From this, I actually disagree with the importance ranking of the previous post. As a
                            starting point, I believe a
                            minimum level of environmental protection should be first and foremost, as not turning our
                            planet into a hothouse
                            wasteland is critical to the survival of our species. Thus, I see the removal of the
                            disposable printer ink cartridges
                            as a significant boon to the environment first, my personal wealth and welfare
                            responsibility second, and as my
                            corporate duty third.</p>
                        <p>However, I agree with the economic status of my hometown being a last-place concern, as I
                            believe market demand will
                            continue for the disposable cartridges for some time. The new generation of printers will
                            not roll out instantaneously,
                            and so neither will the demand for the disposable cartridges disappear instantly. This will
                            give the families of my
                            hometown time to make plans for other employment or possibly plans to move to a different
                            area where employment is more
                            plentiful.</p>
                        <p>In utility, here, there is a significant gain for the world from this new development,
                            combined with a minimal cost in
                            relocating maybe a few thousand people, as dictated by market forces. I believe it would be
                            worse for them to cling to
                            the past, continuing to believe those disposable cartridge manufacturing jobs would last
                            forever.</p>
                        <p>Finally, from the perspective under John Rawls’ Veil of Ignorance, this is (over the long
                            term) an improvement in
                            environmental conditions at medium, non-life-threatening, finite cost to a miniscule part of
                            overall society. This is, I
                            believe, an acceptable decision from that perspective.</p>

                        <p>Based on my ethical framework of pragmatism and utilitarianism, I would go with the
                            Utilitarian Approach. I think moving
                            on to the plan of the refillable cartridges can eventually benefit more people. Despite the
                            shift from the current
                            disposable ones might bring short-term financial crisis and unemployment problems to the
                            local people, it allows our
                            future generations to live in a beautiful Twin Peaks and can result in a more sustainable
                            environment as a whole.</p>
                        <p>To resolve the temporary concerns of the locals, we can announce the layoffs in advance so
                            they can make moving plans
                            accordingly. The refillable cartridges will also cut our profits significantly. However,
                            since the demand of refilling
                            cartridges will increase, we can downsize our manufacturing plant and construct some
                            cartridge refill stations and
                            introduce new positions to help with the refilling process to fill the profit gap. This can
                            be brought out slowly, as
                            the current disposable cartridges can still last five to seven years.</p>

                </tr>
                <tr>

                        <p>While our decision could help reduce the waste problem for the environment, the highest
                            priority for the company should
                            be to maximize profits. Yes we will not supply as many products that use disposable ink
                            cartridges, but our decision
                            should not be swayed by its environmental pros. Rather, it should be in response to the
                            changing market’s new awareness
                            for the harmfulness of disposable ink cartridges. The decision’s beneficial implications for
                            the environment shall be
                            recognized as a bonus (and could possibly be used in advertisements).</p>
                        <p>As for the residents of Twin Peaks, their labor will still be needed as long as our products
                            that use disposable ink
                            cartridges are still being sold. On the surface, this decision gives off the illusion of a
                            false dichotomy between
                            extinguishing the Twin Peaks economy or not adapting to market demands. We can still supply
                            older printer models, while
                            advertising our newer more environmentally-friendly models, so our company can look ethical
                            to the public.</p>
                        <p>My framework for ethical thinking is a mix between pragmatism and utilitarianism as my aim is
                            to bring as much success
                            as possible to the company. In doing so, we can find a viable way to maximize employment in
                            the county of Twin Peaks,
                            and we can advertise our company as being progressive. The potential drop in employment at
                            the plant is a consequence
                            that Twin Peaks will have to endure.</p>

                        <p>The decision of BLI replacing disposable printers ink cartridges with refillable one brings
                            up an ethical dilemma here:
                            Such a move would be helpful for reducing the amount of disposed wastes which also improves
                            environmental conditions,
                            however, making residents of Twin Peaks losing their job opportunities due to reduced
                            cartridges production. It seems
                            like the regular way to resolve this dilemma is to sacrifice one aspect and so only the
                            other gets benefited. However,
                            it’s actually unnecessary to satisfy one and sacrifice another under the ethical concept of
                            eclecticism: There is still
                            a middle ground where the interests of both employees and environments can stand, and
                            eclecticism is aimed to discover
                            such place by making rational trade offs. The final move does not have to prefer one over
                            another when conflicting
                            interests exist by employing eclecticism in such kinds of dilemma.</p>

            <p>Finally, we look at brief overviews of how each ethical framework covered in the first class lecture
                would make their
                decisions on this topic:</p>
            <table>

                        <p>Seeking to do the greatest good for the greatest number, in this case, would require that we
                            protect the environment and
                            develop the refillable cartridges. Our hometown is a small number of people, whereas
                            negative environmental effects will
                            negatively affect all people who exist.</p>

                        <p>Applying the Kantian “Universality Principle,” we see that, if every employee on the planet
                            worked against their
                            corporate interests in favor of their hometown, then capitalism would collapse, work on
                            exported goods such as food
                            would not be completed, and millions would starve. This is an unacceptable outcome, so it
                            must be immoral to act against
                            our corporate duty. Therefore, we must complete the project to develop the refillable

                            hometown, without providing
                            any solution. This is an unacceptable violation of the rights of our hometown, so we cannot
                            assist BLI in perpetrating
                            it. We must not develop refillable printer cartridges.</p>

                        <p>To quote the lecture slide on virtue ethics, “Not much guidance in terms of proper actions.”
                            At best, we could look at
                            the conflict between our virtue of Loyalty (to our hometown) versus the virtues of Order,
                            Duty, and Honor demanded by
                            BLI. But this then becomes a question of which virtues we value more. The decision is
                            binary; the sweet spot aimed for
                            by virtue ethics does not exist. This framework leaves the decision to us, only telling us
                            to suck it up through the
                            consequences.</p>

                        <p>What practical difference exists between producing the new, refillable generation, and not?

                                decline, our continued employment at BLI, the continued existence of BLI and a reduction
                                in environmental damage
                                compared to a disposable-only future.</li>

                                decline, our hometown’s plant is shut
                                down. The environmental damage reduction is the same.</li>

                            employed, we should complete our project and produce the refillable cartridge printer
                            generation.</p>

                            the decision making process. In this case, BLI can consider transforming the factory in Twin
                            Peaks into a refilling
                            station or printer service center: Residents of Twin Peaks would possibly not producing
                            cartridges, but they can instead
                            help customers with their printer issues including refilling cartridges. This makes sure
                            that Twin Peaks avoid
                            unemployment crisis while environment is also put into consideration.</p>

                </tr>
            </table>
            <p>In considering these frameworks, we investigated a number of sources. First and foremost were the class
                lecture slides’
                descriptions, our notes, and Robert Barger’s “Can we find a single Ethical Code?” article.</p>
            <p>We also discovered that, under this dilemma, pragmatism and utilitarianism decay to nearly identical
                arguments, and so
                we spent some time investigating the difference between the two using results such as
                <a
                    href="https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/199/what-is-a-straight-forward-method-for-distinguishing-pragmatic-from-utilitarian">
                    https://philosophy.stackexchange.com/questions/199/what-is-a-straight-forward-method-for-distinguishing-pragmatic-from-utilitarian</a>.
                This led to the realization that, while utilitarians focus on only the amount of human happiness and
                suffering,
                pragmatists, identify the differences between the worlds, taking into account more factors than just
                happiness and/or
                harm. (Like, say, corporate profits.)</p>
            <p>We also took into account the frameworks we expressed in our midterms in building our views on this
                dilemma. As our
                midterms showed clearly our personal frameworks and their grounding, they were valuable tools for
                translating our
                feelings about the current problem into ethical and moral arguments.</p>

            <p>In considering the ethical dilemma reiterated in our previous blog post, we face the question of who our
                decision may affect. There is, present in our decision, both a short-term impact on people directly
                involved in our project and its result, and a possible long-term impact on larger systems the world
                over.</p>
            <p>Our company is transforming our product to be better for the environment as demanded by the market. Here
                are the direct, short-term stakeholders impacted by the results:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Black Lodge Industries -- as the commissioner of the project, and directly benefiting from any
                    discoveries thereof, BLI is an obvious stakeholder.</li>
                <li>Ourselves and our research team -- Face risks from our employers that we might lose our jobs if any
                    individual demonstrates dissent towards developing refillable cartridges.</li>
                <li>BLI Customers -- because refillable cartridges are likely to be more complex and possibly harder to
                    replace, negatively impacting user experience.</li>
                <li>Employment of the factory workers in our hometown -- Local economy may suffer when the production of
                    cartridges comes to an end. Residents of Twin Peaks would undergo unemployment which would have
                    major impact on their daily life.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We are also excited for what our new product may potentially bring about for everybody overall, around
                the globe:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The Environment -- Continued use of disposable cartridges will lead to serious soil pollution when
                    left in landfill. Refilling cartridges, on the other hand, can conserve energy and natural
                    resources.</li>
                <li>The printer market -- moving on to the reusable cartridges can restore market share since the
                    competitors have developed such products on the printer markets.</li>
                <li>The Human impact -- improving the environmental awareness of the public, convincing people to
                    consume additional green products. And if those products come from BLI, the more the better!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now, given the actual impacts imposed on each of these parties and systems, we consider our stakeholders
                in a particular order of importance to our ethical decision making:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>BLI</li>
                <li>Printer market customers</li>
                <li>Our own jobs</li>
                <li>Environment</li>
                <li>Twin Peaks Economy</li>
            </ol>
            <p>We consider BLI’s interest first and foremost, as they were a valuable employer to us in a time of
                economic slowdown. We feel that helping the company’s success is likely to lead to additional jobs for
                many other people. As a second consideration, the market is currently pushing for environmental
                concerns, and obeying the sway of the market is a reasonable good as it makes many people happier with
                BLI. Third, should we choose to refuse to work on the refillable cartridge project, we would lose our
                jobs, bringing upon ourselves significant economic hardship -- and possibly bringing that upon the
                research team below us as well. Our environmentalism, ignored in the past by BLI, actually is in line
                with their decision-making process in this case, and with the first three points.</p>
            <p>Only last do we consider the economy of our hometown, Twin Peaks. As the disposable cartridge printers
                are likely to exist on the market for some time, there will still be a period during which the company
                can warn of future layoffs and restructuring associated with the reusable cartridge program. With this
                proper warning, residents of Twin Peaks can plan for their financial futures. Though it may require
                moving away, it is unlikely that any of them will face an unavoidable financial crisis.</p>

            <h1 class="nomarg medheader">The Ethical Dilemma Ahead</h1>
            <p class="smoltxt">November 8, 2019</p>
            <p>Our team, Iron Giants, has been tasked with determining an ethical pathway through the following dilemma:
            </p>
            <p>45% of our hometown’s economy relies on Inkjet Printer cartridges, an environmentally unsustainable
                technology providing the cheapest high-resolution printing capabilities on the market. The cartridges
                could be made refillable rather than completely disposable, but the company has elected for the cheaper
                disposable only approach. This leads to a significant environmental concern, but one we have ignored in
                the past due to the economic support its industry provides.</p>
            <p>We have been placed in charge of an R&D team developing a new generation of inkjet printers that do not
                use disposable cartridges. We are concerned because this may lead to downsizing or shutdown of the
                cartridge plant in our hometown, stunting our hometown’s economy and placing many residents in dire
                financial situations. There exists also an environmental concern posed by continuing to produce
                disposable cartridges.
            </p>
            <p>The dilemma presented is the torn concerns between supporting our hometown, or supporting the environment
                and our corporate duty as engineers.</p>
            <p>We are also posed two evolutions of the scenario:</p>
            <table>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <h1 class="nomarg smallheader">Scenario 2</h1>
                        <p>Some members of our research team are not convinced of the environmental impacts caused by
                            disposable ink cartridges. However, the market is very aware that this is a big problem. A
                            good research team should always consider the demands of the market.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>
                        <h1 class="nomarg smallheader">Scenario 3</h1>
                        <p>As our development and research team moves on to a proposal of non-disposable and refillable
                            ink cartridges, it will put more people in unemployment status because of the decrease in
                            the demand of producing cartridges. That raises the ethical dilemma of whether we need to be
                            concerned about the unemployment issue in our hometown while designing the printers for the
                            next generation.</p>
                    </td>
                </tr>
            </table>
