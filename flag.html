        <h1>What is the flag?</h1>
        <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pansexual_flag"
                target="_blank"> The pansexual flag</a> is a pink, yellow and
            cyan flag, designed in 2010 as a symbol for the pansexual community
            to increase its visibility and recognition, like the rainbow flag is
            for the LGBT community. It consists of three equally-sized
            horizontal bars, colored pink, yellow, and cyan from top to bottom.

        <h1>Why do you show it?</h1>
        <p>I identify as pansexual, as gender plays little role in whether I am
            attracted to other people sexually or romantically. I am attracted
            to people regardless of their gender identity, gender expression,
            or biological sex. I respect that most folks have preferences. I
            support everyone in their identities of who they're born to love.
